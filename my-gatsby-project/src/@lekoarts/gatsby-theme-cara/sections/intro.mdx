# Hi, I'm Amina Seidi

__ I like to look at myself as a modern day explorer navigating through the ever changing world of the new millenium in which we're living in. This exploration has led me on a journey towards becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. Most days I feel lost without a map but when I realize that, I take a step back, breathe and look at the stars to help navigate me through this world's rough terrain.__

__My drive towards innovation and aquiring all knowledge of the fast paced changes of today's modern world has brought me right here. Although I dont know it all (yet) I countinue to strive in order to become better than how I was yesterday. This mostly includes brushing up on my coding skills, reviewing courses to better understand programming languages and watching other developers content to learn from their experiences. My ideal future involves creating cutting-edge web applications and aesthetically pleasing dynamic websites. After all, I'm a lover of all things fashionable and aesthetically pleasing.__
